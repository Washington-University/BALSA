					BALSA houses extensively analyzed neuroimaging and neuroanatomical datasets mapped 
					to brain atlas surfaces and volumes. BALSA is designed to share BALSA Studies or 
					BALSA Reference datasets, which in addition to data files, contain "scenes" that can 
					be displayed in the Connectome Workbench brain visualization platform. Each BALSA study 
					or Reference dataset can contain several scene files, which in turn can contain several 
					scenes.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few definitions of terms related to BALSA:
				</p>
				<p>
					A <b>BALSA Study</b> is a neuroimaging dataset associated with a published scientific 
					study voluntarily submitted by authors to BALSA for sharing with the community.
				</p>
				<p>
					A <b>BALSA Reference</b> dataset is a curated neuroimaging dataset accurately mapped to 
					brain atlas surfaces and volumes that is meant to serve as a common standard for 
					comparison or use with ongoing studies or other neuroimaging datasets. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A Workbench <b>scene</b> is a saved configuration of settings and filenames (with 
					directory structures)) displayed in the wb_view visualization platform. These settings, 
					which include orientation, zooming, palettes, displayed layers, etc., can be saved 
					globally in a scene file. Multiple scenes can be saved within one scene file.
				</p>
				<p>
					A Workbench <b>scene file</b> organizes one or more scenes to be saved for future use. 
					This allows the user to reopen a Workbench session, including data and settings, 
					(i.e. a scene) at a later time allowing the user to "pick up where they left off." 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Connectome Workbench</b> (aka Workbench) is a software tool for visualizing and 
					performing analyses on brain surface and volume data from multiple species and in 
					several file formats including GIFTI, NIFTI, and CIFTI. Workbench includes wb_view, 
					a graphical user interface for visualizing neuroanatomical data and wb_command, 
					software tools for performing various operations on brain surface and volume 
					files at the command line.  Learn more (or download it)
